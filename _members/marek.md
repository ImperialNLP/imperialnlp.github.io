## Short Bio

I am a researcher in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My work is focused on improving machine learning architectures for representation learning, transfer learning, autoregressive modeling and multi-task optimization. Most of my research is applied in the area of Natural Language Understanding and on tasks that benefit from capturing the semantics in text, such as structured prediction, language modeling, grammatical error detection, sentiment analysis and text classification.

I am a Senior Lecturer of Machine Learning at Imperial College London and a Visiting Researcher at the University of Cambridge. I am an AI Advisor for Gotya Technologies and Esgrid Technologies. I also provide consultancy services through Perception Labs.
