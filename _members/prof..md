## Short Bio

My research focuses on various aspects of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, with a particular interest in multimodal and multilingual context models and work at the intersection of language and vision. My work has various applications such as machine translation, image captioning, quality estimation and text adaptation. I currently hold an ERC (European Research Council) Starting Grant on Multi-modal Context Modelling for Machine Translation. I am also part-time Professor of Language Engineering at the University of Sheffield. Check my Sheffield page for more.
