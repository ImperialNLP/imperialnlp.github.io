## Short Bio

I am a PhD student at the Department of Computing of Imperial College London, supervised by Marek Rei. I am fascinated by large foundation models and work on enhancing their planning, reasoning, and general problem-solving abilities. I also have an interest in model robustness to input perturbations and adversarial attacks.
