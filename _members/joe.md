## Short Bio

I am an NLP PhD student and Apple AI/ML scholar supervised by Marek Rei. My PhD is focussed on creating more robust Natural Language Inference (NLI) models which generalise better to other unseen NLI datasets. I am also interested in model interpretability, where my research has aimed to create inherently interpretable models using atomic decomposition methods. Before my PhD I worked as an analytics consultant at PwC and as a maths teacher on the Teach First programme.
