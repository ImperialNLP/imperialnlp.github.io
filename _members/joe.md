## Short Bio

I am a PhD student in Natural Language Processing, supervised by Marek Rei. My PhD is focussing on creating more robust Natural Language Inference (NLI) models that generalise better to other unseen NLI datasets. Prior to starting the PhD I worked for 6 years as a Consultant at PwC/Strategy&, and recently completed an MSc in Data Science at UCL. I also have a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Warwick, and spent two years as a Mathematics teacher on the Teach First programme.
