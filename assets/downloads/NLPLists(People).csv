Dr Marek Rei,marek.rei@imperial.ac.uk,Huxley 555,Marek is a Seniour Lecturer at Imperial College London.,"I am a researcher in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My work is focused on improving machine learning architectures for representation learning, transfer learning, autoregressive modeling and multi-task optimization. Most of my research is applied in the area of Natural Language Understanding and on tasks that benefit from capturing the semantics in text, such as structured prediction, language modeling, grammatical error detection, sentiment analysis and text classification.

I am a Senior Lecturer of Machine Learning at Imperial College London and a Visiting Researcher at the University of Cambridge. I am an AI Advisor for Gotya Technologies and Esgrid Technologies. I also provide consultancy services through Perception Labs.",Seniour Lecturer in NLP,Staff,marek.png,,,,,,
Prof. Lucia Specia,l.specia@imperial.ac.uk,Huxley 572A,Lucia is a Professor in NLP at Imperial College London,"My research focuses on various aspects of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, with a particular interest in multimodal and multilingual context models and work at the intersection of language and vision. My work has various applications such as machine translation, image captioning, quality estimation and text adaptation. I currently hold an ERC (European Research Council) Starting Grant on Multi-modal Context Modelling for Machine Translation. I am also part-time Professor of Language Engineering at the University of Sheffield. Check my Sheffield page for more.",Professor in NLP,Staff,lucia.jpeg,,,,,,
Joe Stacey,j.stacey20@imperial.ac.uk,Huxley 558,"CS PhD Student in the Computing Department working on NLP, Robustness and Explainability","I am a PhD student in Natural Language Processing, supervised by Marek Rei. My PhD is focussing on creating more robust Natural Language Inference (NLI) models that generalise better to other unseen NLI datasets. Prior to starting the PhD I worked for 6 years as a Consultant at PwC/Strategy&, and recently completed an MSc in Data Science at UCL. I also have a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Warwick, and spent two years as a Mathematics teacher on the Teach First programme.",PhD,PhD,joe.jpg,Dr Marek Rei,,,,,
