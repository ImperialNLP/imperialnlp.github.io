<h1> NLP Group @ Imperial College London </h1>
The NLP Group aims to develop machine learning algorithms for language understanding and generation following a holistic approach where language can be combined with other types of information. In addition to textual context of varying length, our models also sometimes include knowledge in the form of images, videos, audio recordings, sensor data, metadata and knowledge bases. 

Machine learning is at the core of our research. The main areas we work on include large language models (LLMs), robustness & generalisation, LLM reasoning, LLM agents, language generation, machine translation, text adaptation, transfer learning for language, NLP for health and sustainable development, quality evaluation and estimation, and language learning applications.
